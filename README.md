Using LLMS to solve Autism Parenting
**Project Name: Autism Parenting Virtual Assistant**

**Description:**
This project aims to create a virtual assistant powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and the Retrieval Argument Generation (RAG) technique to provide guidance and support to parents of autistic children. The virtual assistant uses a vector store implemented with Chroma, based on data from a study on Autism in Bangladesh, to store and retrieve responses relevant to the users' queries.

**Objective:**
The objective of this project is to offer practical guidance and emotional support to parents of autistic children, helping them navigate the challenges of raising a child with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). By leveraging advanced AI technologies, the virtual assistant aims to empower parents with personalized advice and resources, ultimately contributing to a more inclusive and understanding society for individuals with autism.

**Key Concepts:**

1. **Retrieval Argument Generation (RAG):**
   Retrieval Argument Generation (RAG) is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) that combines information retrieval with language model-based generation. It involves retrieving relevant information from a large database (vector store) and generating a response based on the retrieved information. In this project, RAG is used to provide tailored guidance and support to parents of autistic children based on their specific needs and circumstances.

2. **Vector Store:**
   A vector store is a data structure used to store vectors (numerical representations) of text data. In the context of this project, the vector store implemented with Chroma stores vectors representing responses to queries related to autism parenting. These vectors are used to retrieve relevant responses based on the similarity between the input query and the stored vectors.

3. **Large Language Models (LLMs):**
   Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful machine learning models that have been trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like text. In this project, LLMs are used in conjunction with the vector store and RAG technique to provide natural and contextually relevant responses to parents seeking guidance on autism parenting.
